# Contributing

Please note we have a
[code of conduct](https://github.com/TEECOM/mob/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

To create a new exercise, please create a new pull request!

## Pull Request Info

Though the projects structure is loosely defined, here are some things to keep
in mind:

- Remember to add your exercise to the master list
- Create an exercise specific README with info on the chosen exercise,
  dependency information, how to run tests, etc.
- Before merging, squash all PR commits into a single commit

Thats it for now! As we develop a more standardized process, this guide will
become more detailed.
