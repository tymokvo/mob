# Mob

This repository contains all of the resources used in TEECOM's mob programming
sessions.

## How it works

Every month, TEECOM hosts a mob programming event to learn and grow from each
other. In each session, there is one host who picks the language and exercise.
Then there's the **mob**, which is everyone else!
